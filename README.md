# NetworkingReplicationDemo
A simple tutorial of classic networking replication mechanism

![networking replication](https://github.com/ownself/NetworkingReplicationDemo/blob/master/NetworkingReplication.gif)

the instruction of this demo is followed the principle of series of articles:
[client server game architecture](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html)

This demo implemented following features:
* authoritive server
* client prediction
* entity interpolation
* server buffer
* network lagging simulation
* network package disorder handling
* network package loss handling

Feel free to check out the code, I made this for better understanding the mechanism behind the scene, there still might be bugs or things to be improved, I'll be glad to see mistakes to be pointed out. Thanks!
